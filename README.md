## Installation
My application will use [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) to running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.

## Usage
When the app is opened a landing page is presented with a link to a notes page.

## Contribution
When the notes page is clicked on the user is presented with a page of existing notes in the left hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

Once a new note title and note’s text is entered a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.

once the save icon is clicked the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes


When the existing note in the list is clicked in the left-hand column and that note appears in the right-hand column.


When the write icon is clicked on in the navigation at the top of the page I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
